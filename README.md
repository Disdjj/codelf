# Codelf

> By DJJ & Dannielee

Codelf is a powerful AI-assisted coding tool that provides better code understanding and modification capabilities for AI agents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## MCP Setup

1. Initialize codelf in Cursor/Windsurf agent mode by sending the command:
```
do init-codelf and follow the instructions
```

2. In most cases, prompts will be automatically assembled by codelf

3. After the agent completes writing, you can prompt:

```
do update-project-info
```

## Core Features
